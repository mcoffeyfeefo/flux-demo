# Spring Boot Flux Demo

Example API which demonstrates using reactive programming with spring boot.

The API gets data from an imaginary API containing information about supply depots and inventories and calculates the number of truckloads that are needed to move all the supplies in a particular depot.

Tests are implemented in a BDD style using Spock/Groovy.

Requires Java 17.

Sample build for a relatively slim Docker image included.
